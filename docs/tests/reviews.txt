I always forget that they don't give you that much cheese. I hope this review reinforces it in my brain! Instead, you get almost half a plate of grapes and nuts, another almost half of crackers and then a sliver of each cheese you ordered, to make a whole plate. I only really like a couple of grapes, so to have my plate dominated by it is a waste for me. And the ratio of crackers to cheese is just way off. If you want a nice cheese plate, I'd recommend  Maxine on Shines.<br><br>To make up for it, they have some good food offerings, plus a few desserts.<br><br>Another good thing this place has going for it is it's selection of beers and wines. They have about 8 rotating drafts another 30 or so in bottles. The drafts are specially unique enough to have you wanting to come back to try something new. They also have a beer flight.<br><br>For wines, they have a nice flight going, with descent pours for each, at a decent price.<br><br>Staff are always friendly and helpful here. They also have some cigars, which I haven't tried yet. I'd say I prefer coming here over the Wine Room, which is a few doors down. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/the-yelp-100-challenge-2013-orlando-156" title="Everyone else is doing it, so why can&#39;t I?">The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013</a> </p> <div class="rateReview ufc-feedback clearfix" data-review-id="GQZAENlhDCzmGct2BTlr7A"> <p class="review-intro review-message">Was this review &hellip;?</p> <ul> <li class="useful ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="useful" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-useful-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-useful-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Useful</span> <span class="count">1</span></span></a> </li> <li class="funny ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="funny" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-funny-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-funny-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Funny</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="cool ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="cool" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-cool-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-cool-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Cool</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <p class="userCompLink smallest"> <a href="/signup" rel="eola-wine-company-winter-park" title="Something catch your eye?<br>Bookmark this business to build your own list of fun ideas to check out later!" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-bookmark-common-wrap bookmark"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-bookmark-common"></i> Bookmark</a> <a data-pop-uri="/send_to_friend/review/GQZAENlhDCzmGct2BTlr7A" href="/biz_share?bizid=7KME6VkQvCAfJGBm4JgWPg&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;reviewid=GQZAENlhDCzmGct2BTlr7A" onclick="yelp.ui.widget.SendToFriends.open(this, &#34;7KME6VkQvCAfJGBm4JgWPg&#34;, &#34;GQZAENlhDCzmGct2BTlr7A&#34;, null); return false;" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-envelope-common-wrap sendToFriend send-to-friend"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-envelope-common"></i> Send To A Friend</a> <a href="/biz/eola-wine-company-winter-park#hrid:GQZAENlhDCzmGct2BTlr7A" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-link-common-wrap linkToThis"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-link-common"></i> Link to This Review</a> </p> </div> <div class="review clearfix"> <div class="biz_info"> <address class="smaller"> 9 W Washington St<br>Orlando, FL 32810<br> <span class="smaller">(407) 985-3507</span> </address> <h4> <a href="/biz/elixir-orlando#hrid:RcQj9TaSx-JK0SUml5l1mQ">Elixir </a>&nbsp; </h4> <p class="smaller nobtm"> Category: <a href="/c/orlando-fl-us/bars"> Bars</a> <br> Neighborhood: Downtown </p> </div> <div class="review-meta"> <div class="rating-container"> <div class="rating"> <i class="star-img stars_3" title="3.0 star rating"> <img alt="3.0 star rating" class="offscreen" height="303" src="http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/7d58085d03a1/ico/stars/v2/stars_map.png" width="84"> </i> </div> </div> <span class="smaller date"> 12/30/2013 </span> <span class="review-tags"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common-wrap badge checkin checkin-irregular"><i class="i ig-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common"></i> 1 check-in here</span> </span> </div> <div class="review_comment"> I came here on a Sunday with a group of about 12 people. We probably took up about half the customers. We got to watch football, while we ate and drank.<br><br>I first ordered the tomato bisque soup, which is some of the best I've had. A little spice to it, with chunks of tomatoes. Definitely a fan of this and I recommend it. <br><br>I also ordered the blackened Mahi Salad. The Mahi didn't have an exceptional taste, but it didn't taste bad either. It was on a bed of mixed greens, along with a lemon vinaigrette dressing, which I did like. <br><br>Our service was OK. I had ordered a drink, and she forgot about it, even when I waved at her from across the room with a gesture of "Where's my drink?". She had to come all the way over for me to remind her. She also seemed to spend too much time behind the bar mingling.<br><br>The decor is very laid back here. At least this part makes me want to come back and hang out some more. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/the-yelp-100-challenge-2013-orlando-156" title="Everyone else is doing it, so why can&#39;t I?">The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013</a> </p> <div class="rateReview ufc-feedback clearfix" data-review-id="RcQj9TaSx-JK0SUml5l1mQ"> <p class="review-intro review-message">Was this review &hellip;?</p> <ul> <li class="useful ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="useful" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-useful-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-useful-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Useful</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="funny ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="funny" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-funny-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-funny-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Funny</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="cool ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="cool" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-cool-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-cool-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Cool</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <p class="userCompLink smallest"> <a href="/signup" rel="elixir-orlando" title="Something catch your eye?<br>Bookmark this business to build your own list of fun ideas to check out later!" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-bookmark-common-wrap bookmark"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-bookmark-common"></i> Bookmark</a> <a data-pop-uri="/send_to_friend/review/RcQj9TaSx-JK0SUml5l1mQ" href="/biz_share?bizid=HeADvPhxXCW6Jsv1CaUraA&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;reviewid=RcQj9TaSx-JK0SUml5l1mQ" onclick="yelp.ui.widget.SendToFriends.open(this, &#34;HeADvPhxXCW6Jsv1CaUraA&#34;, &#34;RcQj9TaSx-JK0SUml5l1mQ&#34;, null); return false;" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-envelope-common-wrap sendToFriend send-to-friend"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-envelope-common"></i> Send To A Friend</a> <a href="/biz/elixir-orlando#hrid:RcQj9TaSx-JK0SUml5l1mQ" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-link-common-wrap linkToThis"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-link-common"></i> Link to This Review</a> </p> </div> <div class="review clearfix"> <div class="biz_info"> <address class="smaller"> 1212 Woodward St<br>Orlando, FL 32803<br> <span class="smaller">(407) 898-9672</span> </address> <h4> <a href="/biz/mings-bistro-orlando#hrid:sarWe6ltMnFoaXnWL96qOA">Ming&#39;s Bistro </a>&nbsp; </h4> <p class="smaller nobtm"> Category: <a href="/c/orlando-fl-us/dimsum"> Dim Sum</a> <br> Neighborhood: Colonialtown North </p> </div> <div class="review-meta"> <div class="rating-container"> <div class="rating"> <i class="star-img stars_4" title="4.0 star rating"> <img alt="4.0 star rating" class="offscreen" height="303" src="http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/7d58085d03a1/ico/stars/v2/stars_map.png" width="84"> </i> </div> </div> <span class="smaller date"> 12/30/2013 </span> <span class="review-tags"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common-wrap badge checkin checkin-irregular"><i class="i ig-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common"></i> 1 check-in here</span> </span> </div> <div class="review_comment"> I just came here for Dim Sum with a group of 13 people. The more people you are with,  the better...I say! I always want to try as many items as I can, so with more people, you can order more to share amongst. I'll also split items, to get  more a variety to eat!<br><br>I can't say this place is any more or less special than other Dim Sum restaurants in Orlando, like Chan's or Lam's Garden. Many of the items are similar, if not exactly the same.<br><br>The place was packed today, which is right before News Years eve at noon. Lots of families, both Asian and American. There was no delay in our orders, even with the crowds coming in. They didn't have a cart, like I've experienced at other places, but instead had an order card, similar to a sushi restaurant. What's also nice, is they have a picture menu, with a title of each item, for those non-Chinese readers.<br><br>My favorite items were the Braised chicken feet, Crispy sesame seed balls, Fried turnips, Pan-fried garlic chive dumplings, Sticky rice in lotus leaf, BBQ Pork Rice Crepes and Crispy Taro Dumpling filled with ground meat. I've realized I'm not a fan of many of the seafood dumplings, here or at other Dim Sum restaurants.<br><br>The restaurant is kind of dingy looking, and it's hidden behind the 7 Eleven on Mills and the CVS on 50, but plenty of people know it's back there. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/asian-sensation-orlando" title="I used to be part of a secret Asian nerd club in college.

Most of the night went well. I enjoyed the music and the crowd was very cool. We were mostly 30-40 year olds, because lets face it, Oakenfold is now considered old school.<br><br>I arrived at about 10:30. The show was supposed to start at 10 PM, according to the tickets. There was already a long line outside and the doors weren't even open yet. My friends were meeting at another place and I went to meet them. We ended back at Vain a little after 11, and the line was still very long, but they were letting people in....albeit slowly. Luckily, my friends know one of the DJ's opening up and we were able to get in right away, but I felt bad for all the people who already bought tickets and had to wait on the super slow line. The show was sold out BTW, so they should have expected the crowd.<br><br>I saw in other reviews, complaints about lack of bathrooms on the first floor. There were bathrooms when I was there, on the other side of the bar, so I don't know if it's something they recently added in. There was a bouncer near the bathroom entrance, who seemed happy to see me, every time I used them. They were personal, one person bathrooms too.<br><br>Everything was going well that night. We had bottle service, but at the bar, not the VIP area. The bartenders were cool about giving me water in between the drinks, as I was giving them tips each time.<br><br>The part that got me, was how we were treated when the night was over. All of a sudden, without warning, the lights turned on and the bouncers lined up and started pushing us out of the club. I wish I knew, cause I could have really used the bathroom one last time. Then when we entered the street, on Magnolia, there were police on horses screaming at us to get off the streets and out on to Central. I felt like they were herding us like cattle. I and the other club goers that night were a nice classy bunch and there was no reason to treat us like a bunch of thugs. I don't know if Vain's other nights have an unfavorable crowd, so maybe that's what the bouncers and cops are used to, but this was really uncalled for.<br><br>Another big problem with Orlando clubs, is they don't give you a chance to sober up afterward. Once it's after 2 AM, you're on your own. Luckily my friend's friend lived a couple blocks away, so I had somewhere to chill out for a couple hours, while I sobered up. <br><br>I probably won't come here again, unless an act like Paul Oakenfold comes by again. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/the-yelp-100-challenge-2013-orlando-156" title="Everyone else is doing it, so why can&#39;t I?">The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013</a> </p> <div class="rateReview ufc-feedback clearfix" data-review-id="xuhAZmAzQRuF3FYbvE0Vyg"> <p class="review-intro review-message">Was this review &hellip;?</p> <ul> <li class="useful ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="useful" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-useful-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-useful-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Useful</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="funny ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="funny" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-funny-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-funny-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Funny</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="cool ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="cool" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-cool-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-cool-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Cool</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <p class="userCompLink smallest"> <a href="/signup" rel="vain-orlando" title="Something catch your eye?<br>Bookmark this business to build your own list of fun ideas to check out later!" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-bookmark-common-wrap bookmark"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-bookmark-common"></i> Bookmark</a> <a data-pop-uri="/send_to_friend/review/xuhAZmAzQRuF3FYbvE0Vyg" href="/biz_share?bizid=64tl2__6BTtDYQhDf7nxJA&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;reviewid=xuhAZmAzQRuF3FYbvE0Vyg" onclick="yelp.ui.widget.SendToFriends.open(this, &#34;64tl2__6BTtDYQhDf7nxJA&#34;, &#34;xuhAZmAzQRuF3FYbvE0Vyg&#34;, null); return false;" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-envelope-common-wrap sendToFriend send-to-friend"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-envelope-common"></i> Send To A Friend</a> <a href="/biz/vain-orlando#hrid:xuhAZmAzQRuF3FYbvE0Vyg" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-link-common-wrap linkToThis"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-link-common"></i> Link to This Review</a> </p> </div> <div class="review clearfix"> <div class="biz_info"> <address class="smaller"> 1905 N Orange Ave<br>Orlando, FL 32804<br> <span class="smaller">(407) 237-0921</span> </address> <h4> <a href="/biz/wolfies-pizzamia-orlando#hrid:Dse6GI8vPhcKsWWIqvU3zg">Wolfies Pizzamia </a>&nbsp; </h4> <p class="smaller nobtm"> Categories: <a href="/c/orlando-fl-us/pizza"> Pizza</a>, <a href="/c/orlando-fl-us/italian"> Italian</a>, <a href="/c/orlando-fl-us/sandwiches"> Sandwiches</a> <br> </p> </div> <div class="review-meta"> <div class="rating-container"> <div class="rating"> <i class="star-img stars_3" title="3.0 star rating"> <img alt="3.0 star rating" class="offscreen" height="303" src="http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/7d58085d03a1/ico/stars/v2/stars_map.png" width="84"> </i> </div> </div> <span class="smaller date"> 12/29/2013 </span> <span class="review-tags"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common-wrap badge checkin checkin-irregular"><i class="i ig-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common"></i> 1 check-in here</span> </span> </div> <div class="review_comment"> The place has changed a bit since last time I came earlier in the year.<br><br>The decor is mostly the same, but they changed some of the seating from high tops, to regular height tables.<br><br>I noticed the portions for the food ordered were about twice the size as before. This was good, because I felt I didn't get enough food in the past.<br><br>I had the Carbonara, which for Wolfies, is a perfect dish, since they cure their own meats. This looked pretty authentic. They placed a semi-cooked egg on top of it, which I've only seen 2 other instances. One was at the now closed Lagos and the other is from my mom, who's Sicilian. The taste was good and the only complaint I had, is it was a bit salty for me. I don't know if it was just the cured pork that was salty, but I felt like they added extra salt to it too. This is again a problem I have with many Italian style restaurants and the cooks decision to add too much salt. If your customers want their food salty, they can just add it in themselves. <br><br>Among 4 of us, we shared a large salad. The salad was actually larger than I expected and could have fed at least 6 people. I think I had about 3 helpings of it. It was a good deal and I'll give it about 4 stars for taste, only because it was a bit too tangy for me.<br><br>I also had their autumn cocktail. It was good, but could have used a bit less sours for me. Maybe my taste bugs just can't handle tangy and sour anymore.<br><br>Service was OK. The server was kind of nice. I say kind of, because I think she might have been having a bad day. When we got our large salad, it came with no serving utensils. When I asked her for a serving spoon, she acted as if it was a weird question and I felt like she reluctantly gave it to us.<br><br>I didn't have time for dessert, as we were going to see A Christmas Carol at the Theater Downtown. I hope to try one next time. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/the-yelp-100-challenge-2013-orlando-156" title="Everyone else is doing it, so why can&#39;t I?">The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013</a> </p> <div class="rateReview ufc-feedback clearfix" data-review-id="Dse6GI8vPhcKsWWIqvU3zg"> <p class="review-intro review-message">Was this review &hellip;?</p> <ul> <li class="useful ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="useful" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-useful-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-useful-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Useful</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="funny ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="funny" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-funny-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-funny-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Funny</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="cool ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="cool" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-cool-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-cool-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Cool</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <p class="userCompLink smallest"> <a href="/signup" rel="wolfies-pizzamia-orlando" title="Something catch your eye?<br>Bookmark this business to build your own list of fun ideas to check out later!" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-bookmark-common-wrap bookmark"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-bookmark-common"></i> Bookmark</a> <a data-pop-uri="/send_to_friend/review/Dse6GI8vPhcKsWWIqvU3zg" href="/biz_share?bizid=Mn_sgyOyg5Q6ExsckrbLew&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;reviewid=Dse6GI8vPhcKsWWIqvU3zg" onclick="yelp.ui.widget.SendToFriends.open(this, &#34;Mn_sgyOyg5Q6ExsckrbLew&#34;, &#34;Dse6GI8vPhcKsWWIqvU3zg&#34;, null); return false;" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-envelope-common-wrap sendToFriend send-to-friend"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-envelope-common"></i> Send To A Friend</a> <a href="/biz/wolfies-pizzamia-orlando#hrid:Dse6GI8vPhcKsWWIqvU3zg" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-link-common-wrap linkToThis"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-link-common"></i> Link to This Review</a> </p> </div> <div class="review clearfix"> <div class="biz_info"> <address class="smaller"> 140 N Orlando Ave<br>Winter Park, FL 32789<br> <span class="smaller">(407) 513-4912</span> </address> <h4> <a href="/biz/carmel-cafe-and-wine-bar-winter-park#hrid:iDhN-AzsH3btbyEwQMcwhA">Carmel Cafe &amp; Wine Bar </a>&nbsp; </h4> <p class="smaller nobtm"> Categories: <a href="/c/winter-park-fl-us/mediterranean"> Mediterranean</a>, <a href="/c/winter-park-fl-us/wine_bars"> Wine Bars</a> <br> Neighborhood: Winter Park </p> </div> <div class="review-meta"> <div class="rating-container"> <div class="rating"> <i class="star-img stars_5" title="5.0 star rating"> <img alt="5.0 star rating" class="offscreen" height="303" src="http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/7d58085d03a1/ico/stars/v2/stars_map.png" width="84"> </i> </div> </div> <span class="smaller date"> 12/29/2013 </span> <span class="review-tags"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common-wrap badge checkin checkin-irregular"><i class="i ig-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common"></i> 1 check-in here</span> </span> </div> <div class="review_comment"> My wife has been telling me about this place for a few months now. Let me just say that it was worth the wait. From the service to the food I ate, everything was great!<br><br>I went for the whole Carmel Café House Salad and the Grilled Lemon Chicken &amp; Artichoke flat bread. You can do half portions of each, but I did the whole thing. <br><br>The salad was one of the best I've had anywhere. I'm very picky about my salads and usually hate house salads at other restaurants, because they use tasteless ingredients, like iceberg lettuce or pale tomatoes. This one met my standards completely, which its organic mixed greens, grape tomato, red onion, English cucumber, carrot, feta and lemon-herb vinaigrette. I don't even really like cucumber, but the dressing was so good, it made me overlook that it was a cucumber.<br><br>Lemon chicken is one of my favorite meals, and I loved it on the flat bread.<br><br>Our waiter was pretty cool too. He showed us how to use their ordering system on the I-pad. <br> I ended up just ordering through the waiter, just because I like the personal touch better, than always relying on a machine.<br><br>Looking forward to trying this place again. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/the-yelp-100-challenge-2013-orlando-156" title="Everyone else is doing it, so why can&#39;t I?">The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013</a> </p> <div class="rateReview ufc-feedback clearfix" data-review-id="iDhN-AzsH3btbyEwQMcwhA"> <p class="review-intro review-message">Was this review &hellip;?</p> <ul> <li class="useful ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="useful" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-useful-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-useful-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Useful</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="funny ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="funny" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-funny-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-funny-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Funny</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="cool ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="cool" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-cool-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-cool-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Cool</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <p class="userCompLink smallest"> <a href="/signup" rel="carmel-cafe-and-wine-bar-winter-park" title="Something catch your eye?<br>Bookmark this business to build your own list of fun ideas to check out later!" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-bookmark-common-wrap bookmark"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-bookmark-common"></i> Bookmark</a> <a data-pop-uri="/send_to_friend/review/iDhN-AzsH3btbyEwQMcwhA" href="/biz_share?bizid=1yNVqpE_GayexnJFt42G4g&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;reviewid=iDhN-AzsH3btbyEwQMcwhA" onclick="yelp.ui.widget.SendToFriends.open(this, &#34;1yNVqpE_GayexnJFt42G4g&#34;, &#34;iDhN-AzsH3btbyEwQMcwhA&#34;, null); return false;" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-envelope-common-wrap sendToFriend send-to-friend"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-envelope-common"></i> Send To A Friend</a> <a href="/biz/carmel-cafe-and-wine-bar-winter-park#hrid:iDhN-AzsH3btbyEwQMcwhA" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-link-common-wrap linkToThis"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-link-common"></i> Link to This Review</a> </p> </div> <div class="review clearfix"> <div class="biz_info"> <address class="smaller"> 4824 New Broad St<br>Orlando, FL 32814<br> <span class="smaller">(407) 893-8150</span> </address> <h4> <a href="/biz/hair-cuttery-orlando-15#hrid:Q40AGwlKa3JjHcA4GRuXCg">Hair Cuttery </a>&nbsp; </h4> <p class="smaller nobtm"> Category: <a href="/c/orlando-fl-us/hair"> Hair Salons</a> <br> Neighborhood: Baldwin Park </p> </div> <div class="review-meta"> <div class="rating-container"> <div class="rating"> <i class="star-img stars_4" title="4.0 star rating"> <img alt="4.0 star rating" class="offscreen" height="303" src="http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/7d58085d03a1/ico/stars/v2/stars_map.png" width="84"> </i> </div> </div> <span class="smaller date"> 12/24/2013 </span> <span class="review-tags"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common-wrap badge checkin checkin-irregular"><i class="i ig-common i-checkin-burst-blue-small-common"></i> 1 check-in here</span> </span> </div> <div class="review_comment"> Ugg...last time I came here their hair cut price went from $15 to $17.

I always feel like the servers are timid though...as if they are afraid of offending you. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/asian-sensation-orlando" title="I used to be part of a secret Asian nerd club in college.

I like to make mine as healthy has I can. One of their wheat breads. I choose the leaner meats, and use the more nutritious veges, like spinach, red onions, olives, tomatoes and cucumbers. I try not to add on the thick sugary and fatty dressings, and opt for mustard, or oil and vinegar with some oregano. <br><br>Their bread is freshly baked and cookies too (sometimes I'll get a 3 pack of the latter). <br><br>Usually the service is good, but you'll get a random person, so I suppose it depends. <br><br>There is good seating inside, with customer accessible drinks, so you can get free refills yourself. And they have a couple of nice tables outsides. You can also just take you sub down to the lake, a couple short streets away, and eat it there too. </div> <p class="userLists"> <span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-list-common-wrap"><i class="i ig-common i-list-common"></i> Listed in:</span> <a href="/list/my-neighborhood-baldwin-park-orlando" title="My local dry cleaner, watering hole, deli, cafe, etc.">My Neighborhood - Baldwin Park</a>, <a href="/list/the-yelp-100-challenge-2013-orlando-156" title="Everyone else is doing it, so why can&#39;t I?">The Yelp 100 Challenge - 2013</a> </p> <div class="rateReview ufc-feedback clearfix" data-review-id="5pNBI_no6IaD-h99hDUcfQ"> <p class="review-intro review-message">Was this review &hellip;?</p> <ul> <li class="useful ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="useful" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-useful-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-useful-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Useful</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="funny ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="funny" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-funny-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-funny-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Funny</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> <li class="cool ufc-stat inline-block ytype"> <a href="javascript:;" rel="cool" class="ybtn ybtn-tertiary ybtn-large inline-block"><span class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-ufc-cool-common-wrap button-content"><i class="i ig-common i-ufc-cool-common"></i> <span class="vote-type">Cool</span> <span class="count"></span></span></a> </li> </ul> </div> <p class="userCompLink smallest"> <a href="/signup" rel="subway-orlando" title="Something catch your eye?<br>Bookmark this business to build your own list of fun ideas to check out later!" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-bookmark-common-wrap bookmark"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-bookmark-common"></i> Bookmark</a> <a data-pop-uri="/send_to_friend/review/5pNBI_no6IaD-h99hDUcfQ" href="/biz_share?bizid=UjcKnRfwHEGYYYUdYdGzEQ&amp;return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DAMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;reviewid=5pNBI_no6IaD-h99hDUcfQ" onclick="yelp.ui.widget.SendToFriends.open(this, &#34;UjcKnRfwHEGYYYUdYdGzEQ&#34;, &#34;5pNBI_no6IaD-h99hDUcfQ&#34;, null); return false;" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-envelope-common-wrap sendToFriend send-to-friend"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-envelope-common"></i> Send To A Friend</a> <a href="/biz/subway-orlando#hrid:5pNBI_no6IaD-h99hDUcfQ" class="i-wrap ig-wrap-common i-orange-link-common-wrap linkToThis"><i class="i ig-common i-orange-link-common"></i> Link to This Review</a> </p> </div> <div style="border-top:solid 1px #ccc;padding:5px 0px;margin:0px;"> <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="98%" class="fs_pagination_controls"> <tr> <td class="range-of-total"> <span>1 to 10 of 138</span> </td> <td class="go-to-page"> <span class="pagination-text">Go to Page</span> <strong>1</strong> <a id="pager_page_2" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=10"> 2</a> <a id="pager_page_3" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=20"> 3</a> <a id="pager_page_4" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=30"> 4</a> <a id="pager_page_5" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=40"> 5</a> <a id="pager_page_6" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=50"> 6</a> <a id="pager_page_7" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=60"> 7</a> <a id="pager_page_8" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=70"> 8</a> <a id="pager_page_9" class="pager-page" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=80"> 9</a> ... </td> <td align="right" class="nav-links">Previous | <a id="pager_page_next" class="pager-page" accesskey="n" href="/user_details_reviews_self?userid=AMaRAzW-FXc2hqrBmHS40w&amp;rec_pagestart=10">Next</a></td> </tr> </table> </div> <br style="clear:both;" /> </div>
